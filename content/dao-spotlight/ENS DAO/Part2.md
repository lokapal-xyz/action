## Voting

The key aspects of ENS DAO voting process are:

- Delegation
- Governance Environments
- Social and Executable Proposals
- Steward Elections

The ENS DAO uses token-weighted voting – one token, one vote. $ENS tokens must be delegated **before** a proposal is set into motion. When a proposal is open for voting, it is announced on the ENS DAO [**governance forum**](https://discuss.ens.domains/) and [**Twitter/X account**](https://x.com/ENS_DAO). Delegates are asked to vote on all Social and Executable proposals, as well as Steward Elections.

## Delegation

$ENS tokens must be delegated to an Ethereum address in order to have governance power. Here are some important delegation considerations: 

- Tokens can be self-delegated or delegated to another address. 
- Address delegation remains until modified, or after changes in token ownership.
- Delegation is flexible and can be changed at any time by the token holder. 
- Delegations cannot be split – either zero or all tokens are delegated from and to an address.
- You can't delegate tokens locked on centralized exchanges.

If you control an Ethereum address with delegated $ENS tokens, **you are a delegate**. Now you are able to vote on ENS DAO proposals. Delegates' voting history is open to everyone. This is important for $ENS token holders in order to select a delegate that aligns with their governance choices. Delegates are not required to own $ENS tokens, which allows people with a particular expertise to vote on behalf of a pool of token holders.

## Governance Environments

ENS DAO governance environments include:

- Governance forum – participation requires account registration.
- Working Group Meetings – regular meetings are held weekly.
- Twitter/X – posts updates frequently.
- Tally – used for Executable Proposals and $ENS delegation.
- Snapshot – used for Social Proposals and Working Group elections.

## Proposals

There are three types of ENS DAO voting procedures: 

- Social Proposals
- Executable Proposals
- Steward Elections

**Social Proposals** are off-chain procedures that ask for the agreement of the DAO on a social consideration that cannot be enforced on-chain. They are posted on the ENS DAO Snapshot space and are open for 5 days. Voting is free and does not require gas. Votes can be changed for free at any time before a vote ends. Social proposals can be put forward by any Delegate with at least **10,000 $ENS**. 

**Executable Proposals** are on-chain procedures able to execute smart contract operations – if they are approved. Proposals are open for 7 days, and can be viewed on Tally or Agora. Voting is not free and requires gas. Votes cannot be changed once they are cast. Executable proposals can be put forward to a vote by any Delegate with at least **100,000 $ENS tokens**.

**Steward Elections** take place each year in December. Each working group will elect three stewards per Term. Steward elections are administered by the Meta-Goverance Working Group. Information about working group elections are posted in the governance forum.

These procedures are well-defined and nuanced. Refer to the official documentation for full technical details.

## Working Groups

The ENS DAO uses working groups to manage the DAO’s work-related activities – without requiring a Social or Executable Proposal. As of 2025, there are three working groups:

- Meta-Governance
- ENS Ecosystem
- Public Goods

Each working group has a set of rules, approved by Social Proposal in December 2021. The rules were modified in June 2022 and November 2023. Working groups have three stewards each – they are elected to serve for a 12 months term. The stewards appoint a secretary for the Term. Working groups' budget must be approved by Social Proposal. These funds are then managed by a 3-of-4 multi-sig.

[**Meta-Governance**](https://basics.ensdao.org/metagovernance-wg) Working Group responsibilities include:

- Governance oversight.
- Management and operational support.
- DAO treasury management.

[**ENS Ecosystem**](https://basics.ensdao.org/ens-ecosystem-wg) Working Group responsibilities include:

- ENS' growth and improvement.
- Funding projects intrinsic to ENS.
- Supporting programs centered on ENS.

[**Public Goods**](https://basics.ensdao.org/public-goods) Working Group responsibilities include:

- Enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem.
- Funding non-ENS projects.
- Channeling grants via third-party platforms (e.g., Gitcoin).

Soliciting funding from Working Groups is done according to their specific procedures. Please refer to ENS DAO channels for more information.
