title: Part 3 – Observations on ENS DAO's Strengths and Challenges
---

## Strengths in Practice

Working Groups are receptive to community concerns over proposal procedures. For example, a proposal regarding [**provider selection for the Service Provider Program**](https://snapshot.box/#/s:spp-test.eth/proposal/0xe5c5f5772c93d1336e29a9f7a8f3890f1ace5456fb2794c34d10a57b82f2108d) was set to go live after a 24-hour test period. Some members raised concerns over limited test time. So, the Meta-Governance Working Group [**postponed**](https://x.com/ENS_DAO/status/1917342287379718387) the live vote, and the test period was extended from the original 24 hours to 7 days.

The long term vision for ENS DAO is to become self-sufficient to avoid market dependency. For this, they periodically [**transfer DAO assets**](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/31309365093913580207991288430108338667724061355449265288906484597789511363394) to their Endowment. This growth in investable funds is accompanied by an [**Investment Policy Statement**](https://snapshot.box/#/s:ens.eth/proposal/0x085a1e40c264ffd44567b6dce889f5943e72cfa8442eaeb81819261a38f0bd0a), outlining principles and guidelines for management efficiency. ENS DAO is fostering financial growth while maintaining accountability.

The protocol is in the process of diversifying [**ENS Endowment’s reserves**](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/7404040509873168432228479064563591804702835162347907107082011204120525681390). Each diversification proposal details the specific asset choices (e.g., USDT, RWAs) and their reasoning behind them (higher liquidity, off-chain integration). This shows financial risks awareness and volatility management.

## Ongoing Challenges

The [**Security Council**](https://basics.ensdao.org/security-council) has authorization to stop harmful proposals – it can't amend or initiate governance actions. This limited emergency power works great when protocols have a limited governance scope. If ENS DAO continues to grow and their governance components increase, there could be a point in which more security capabilities are needed (e.g., freezing ENS Endowment funds to prevent a live hack). A stronger Security Council may require a signers increase to their 4-of-8 multi-sig system. Such a change could help prevent multi-sig vulnerabilities seen in cases like the [**2024 Radiant Capital attacks**](https://rekt.news/radiant-capital-rekt2).

The enlargement of the ENS Endowment mentioned before can raise DAO's funds, but also increases security concerns over governance attacks. Continuous security research is needed to mitigate these risks – both internally (ENS Security Council) and with external researchers (bounty programs and formal audits). This will be a constant trade-off battle for ENS DAO – between accelerating self-sufficiency, mitigating financial risks and managing attack surface. *On the path of growth, how fast is too fast?*.

## Strategic Questions for Growth

One potential challenge this protocol may face is becoming a victim of its own success. *Stability breeds apathy* – this can lead members to assume good performance and stop examining properly each governance decision. External governance attacks are mitigated by ENS DAO's methodical proposal cycle. Therefore, internal loss of governance priorities may be the highest danger.

Future mass adoption of ENS names can radically transform the current governance framework. Client growth may eventually need a restructuring of ENS Working Groups. This "Executive Branch" expansion may be problematic for decentralized-minded members. Also, ENS institutionalization on the blockchain ecosystem could draw attention from regulators.

ENS success fosters third-party applications. For example, some projects are considering applying ENS technology to [**smart contract addresses**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/smart-contract-naming-with-enscribe/20657). This would allow easier interactions with more Web3 components. Among the hurdles of this type of implementation is integration with existing technology like development frameworks, wallets, blockchain explorers, etc. Also, if a third-party doesn't perform as expected, it may damage ENS reputation on the public eye – even if the DAO is not involved, or only offered some assistance via the [**ENS Ecosystem Working Group**](https://basics.ensdao.org/ens-ecosystem-wg).

## Ecosystem Impact

Overall, ENS DAO is raising the bar in the Web3 ecosystem for achieving governance stability, long term vision and institutional transparency. The *infra tool set* of blockchain technology – wallets, domain management, oracle networks – is less troubled by the internal wars and external attacks that plague other type of protocols, like DeFi and DEX platforms. But this is not an excuse to allow governance complacency – a lesson that ENS DAO is handling gracefully so far.

Web3 needs protocols that represent the blockchain philosophy at its best – seeking innovation while maintaining professionalism. For each memecoin and rug pull that drags respect for Web3 one step behind, there are many protocols following ENS’s lead – pushing forward on the path of greater blockchain adoption. Any DAO that aspires for governance clarity and efficiency may consider ENS DAO as a reference to emulate and further improve.
